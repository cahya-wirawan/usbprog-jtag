Please mail patches to:

openocd-development@lists.berlios.de

The patch should be against svn trunk using an SVN
diff. 

Attach the patch to the email as a .txt file and
also write a short change log entry that maintainers
can copy and paste into the commit message

Add yourself to the GPL copyright for non-trivial changes.

To create a patch from the command line:
 
svn diff >mypatch.txt

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re09.html

NB! remember to use "svn add" on new files first!

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/re01.html



If you have a decent SVN GUI, then that should be
able to create and apply patches as well...
